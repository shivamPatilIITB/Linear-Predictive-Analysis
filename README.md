**Resume Points:**
Linear Predictive Analysis and Re-synthesis of Speech Signals | Speech Processing

Instructor: Prof. Preeti Rao, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Autumn 2022)

(a) Implemented Levinson-Durbin Recursion to compute LP Coefficients for an audio signal

(b) Compared LPC magnitude spectrum for various orders with the original spectrum of given audio file

(c) Extracted residual error signal by carrying out Inverse Filtering using 10th order LP coefficients

(d) Reconstructed the original signal using best estimated LP filter with impulse train of estimated pitch period
